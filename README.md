# Standard Model I

These are my notes from the first half of a [course of lectures][course-page] taken Sepâ€“Dec 2015.

## Building the notes
### Compiling with _pdfTeX_
`pdflatex` and `mpost` (usually in _/usr/texbin_ or _/Library/TeX/texbin_ on Mac) must be in the `PATH` environment variable.

As usual, we have to run the TeX compiler twice:
```shell
pdflatex -file-line-error -interaction=nonstopmode SM1.tex
pdflatex -file-line-error -interaction=nonstopmode SM1.tex
```
The output is in _SM1.pdf_.

### Cleaning the directory
To remove all the temporary files spewed out during compilation:
```shell
rm -f SM1.aux SM1.toc SM1.out *.log *.mp *.1 *.t1
```
